  text1: 'Strain Gauge is an important sensor used in geotechnical fields to measure the amount of strain on any structure. '
  text2: 'The resistance of a strain gauge varies with applied force and, it converts parameters such as force, pressure, tension, weight, etc. into a change in resistance that can be measured later on. '
  text3: 'This is because whenever an external force is applied to an object, it tends to change its shape and size thereby, altering its resistance. '
